This is a python script for the Makerlife Weatherstation to push data via MQTT to e.g. Homeassistant. To get it work with homeassistant, a MQTT broker has to be configured and filled in to the script. Also a couple of sensors has to be added to HA. 

The data is pushed every 5 min. The time to can be changed if the interval variable is changed. The wind measurement is done during the interval secoconds. Each publish consits of 15 measurement rounds.

Paho Mqtt has to be added to your python installation. 
`pip install paho-mqtt`

Example of configuration.yaml:
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "outside/weather/"
    icon: mdi:weather-windy
    name: 'Windspeed'
    unit_of_measurement: 'm/s'
    value_template: '{{ value_json.windspeed | round(1) }}'
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "outside/weather/"
    icon: mdi:thermometer-lines
    name: 'Temperaure'
    unit_of_measurement: 'Â°C'
    value_template: '{{ value_json.temperature | round(1) }}'
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "outside/weather/"
    icon: mdi:weather-rainy
    name: 'Rain'
    unit_of_measurement: 'mm'
    value_template: '{{ value_json.rain | round(1) }}'
```

Edit the scirpt with your MQTT broker IP and Pass. <br>

Login to the you raspi via SSH. Start the script with:<br>
`nohup python weather.py &` <br>
This enables to logut from the pi without closing the down the script.
